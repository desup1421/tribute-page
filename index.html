        <h2 id="tribute-title">Here's a time line of Nikola Tesla's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">1856 </span> - Nikola Tesla was born on July 10 in Smiljan, a small village in the region of Croatia which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1875</span> - Tesla began his engineering education at Graz University of Technology in Austria, but later moved to Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1881</span> - Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, where he worked as a telephone engineer for a telegraph company.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1884</span> - Tesla arrived in the United States and began working for Thomas Edison in New York City. However, differences of opinion between them led Tesla to leave his job a year later.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1887</span> - Tesla established his own company, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing, where he focused on research and development in the field of electrical power.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1888</span> - Tesla invented the alternating current induction motor, which allowed energy transfer without wires. He also developed the three-phase electric motor and an efficient electrical power system.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1891</span> - Tesla patented his alternating current power distribution system, which became the basis for modern power generation.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1893</span> - He introduced the concept of the Wardenclyffe Tower, an ambitious project to transmit electrical energy wirelessly through the earth. However, the project failed due to lack of funding.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1901</span> - Tesla successfully transmitted radio signals from New York to Cornwall, England, demonstrating the potential for long-distance wireless communication.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1915</span> - After deep financial difficulties, Tesla canceled his experiments and lived a relatively isolated life in New York City.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1943</span> - Tesla passed away on January 7 in New York City at the age of 86.</li>
